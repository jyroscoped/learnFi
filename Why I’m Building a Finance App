I’m 16, I go to a good school, I take challenging classes, and yet nobody has ever taught me how to invest, save, or build wealth.
Most teens my age don’t know how credit cards work, what a stock is, or how to make money work for them. That’s a problem.
That's why I'm creating an app to educate young adults about finance and investment in an intuitive and understandable way. I'll be learning along the way too, and I fully believe this project can make a difference for teens like me.

Today I began by creating a template for my project in Figma. The template ensures intuitiveness and encourages interaction for users. I began to cover features that I believe will be userful in the app.
1. AI chat
The AI chatbot will be the main feature of this app and tutors users about stocks and provides insights about market actions.
2. Charts and Data Tables
These will provide the user with information about a stock or index; features essential for understanding a stock.
3. Company Information
This provides a description of the company, which allows the user to predcit its success and provides as another valuable feature for predictions.
